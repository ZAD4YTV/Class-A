# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

# You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

# A function can return data as a result.

# In python, the functions are defined with the "def" function, for example:

def welcomerfunction():
    print("So this is my example function")

welcomerfunction() # This will exec the function.

# And i can add some arguments, for example

def customerWelcomeFunction(customername):
    print("Welcome " + customername + " to the class.")

customerWelcomeFunction("Pepito") # This will exec the function with the argument of customername = Pepito 
# And return it.
