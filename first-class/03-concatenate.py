# So, i can concatenate variables in the print() function, for example:

x = 5 # This is an Int variable.

print(f"Hi, {x} its the data inside of the x variable")

y = "Hello World" # This is a string variable.
teachingLanguage = "Python"  # This is a string variable.

print(f"{y}, I am teaching with {teachingLanguage}")
print(y, "I am teaching with", teachingLanguage)

# Also, there are 2 more types of variables, bool and float.

myBool = True # This is a bool variable
mySecondBool = False # This is also a bool variable

print(f"Yes, is {myBool} that.")
print(f"No, it is {mySecondBool}.")


pi = 3.14 # And this is a float variable. 

print(f"In the school, my math teacher makes me know PI is: {pi}")
